# Panic freedom

Let's start with a simple example: a function that squares a `u8`
integer. Set up a fresh Rust project to follow along:
```
cargo new hax-tutorial --lib
cd hax-tutorial
```

Replace the content of `src/lib.rs` with our new squaring function:
```{.rust}
pub fn square(x: u8) -> u8 {
    x * x
}
```

## Extracting Lean code

Run the following command to extract Lean code from this Rust project:
```
cargo hax into lean --lakefile
```
The `--lakefile` option will automatically set up the Lean scaffolding to
obtain a working Lean project. The resulting Lean project can be found in the
`proofs/lean` directory.

The file `proofs/lean/HaxTutorial/Extraction/Funs.lean` contains (among some boilerplate code) the translation of our `square` function:
```{.lean}
def square (x : Std.U8) : Result Std.U8 := do
  x * x
```
To type-check the extraction, run
```
cd proofs/lean
lake build
```
The first time you run this, it might take a while to download dependencies.
Ultimately, the type checking succeeds. If you have used the F* backend before,
this might come as a surprise because the function can panic when `x` so large that the
multiplication causes an integer overflow.
In Lean, our translation is wrapped in a monad called `Result` that allows us
to model functions that panic.

## Specifying panic-freedom

To try to prove panic-freedom, we have to 
specify that the result of `square` is expected not to be an error in this result type.
To add a specification, we need to add `hax_lib` as a dependency of our Rust package:
```
cargo add --git https://github.com/hacspec/hax hax-lib
```
Now we can add a simple specification as follows:
```{.rust}
#[hax_lib::ensures(|res| true)]
pub fn square(x: u8) -> u8 {
    x * x
}
```
Adding a `hax_lib::ensures` annotation will make hax generate a Lean specification of the function, asserting panic freedom as well as the postcondition. Here, we used the trivial postcondition `true`, so we only assert panic freedom.

However, as stated, our specification is not correct.
The reason is that the multiplication can overflow when `x` is too large, and this will
cause a panic in Rust's debug mode.

Multiplication is not the only panicking function provided by the Rust
library: most of the other integer arithmetic operation have such
informal assumptions.
Another source of panics is indexing. Indexing in an array, a slice or
a vector is a partial operation: the index might be out of range.

## Fixing the specification
There is an informal assumption to the
multiplication operator in Rust: the inputs should be small enough so
that the multiplication doesn't overflow.

Note that Rust also provides `wrapping_mul`, a non-panicking variant
of the multiplication on `u8` that wraps when the result is bigger
than `255`. Replacing the common multiplication with `wrapping_mul` in
`square` would fix the panic, but then, `square(256)` returns zero.
Semantically, this is not what one would expect from `square`.

Our problem is that our function `square` is well-defined only when
its input is within `0` and `15`.

The solution is to add a precondition to restrict the inputs and
stay in the domain where the multiplication fits in a `u8`.
We can do so using the `hax_lib::requires` annotation: 
```{.rust}
#[hax_lib::requires(x < 16)]
#[hax_lib::ensures(|res| true)]
pub fn square(x: u8) -> u8 {
    x * x
}
```

To generate the Lean specification, we need to reextract:
```
cargo hax into lean
```
Now, hax produces two additional files: The file `proofs/lean/HaxTutorial/Extraction/Specs.lean`
contains the specification for our `square` function:
```{.lean}
/-- [hax_tutorial::square::pre]:
    Source: 'src/lib.rs', lines 1:0-1:28 -/
@[reducible] def square.pre (x : Std.U8) : Result Bool := do
               ok (x < 16#u8)

/-- [hax_tutorial::square::post]:
    Source: 'src/lib.rs', lines 2:0-2:31 -/
@[reducible]
def square.post (x : Std.U8) (res : Std.U8) : Result Bool := do
  ok true

def square.spec (x : Std.U8) : Prop :=
  (square.pre x).holds →
  ⦃ ⌜ True ⌝ ⦄
  square x
  ⦃ ⇓ res => ⌜ (square.post x res).holds ⌝ ⦄
```
This file defines 
- the precondition `square.pre` that we have provided via the `hax_lib::requires` annotation,
- the postcondition `square.post` that we have provided via the `hax_lib::ensures`
clause, and
- a definition `square.spec` of our overall specification.


## Proving the specification correct

Now, we'd like to
prove that specification correct. To this end, hax already generated a template
`proofs/lean/HaxTutorial/Extraction/ProofObligations.lean` for us. Copy the template and put
it into a new directory `proofs/lean/HaxTutorial/Proofs/Proofs.lean`.
To let Lean know about this new file, add the following line into `proofs/lean/HaxTutorial.lean`:
```{.lean}
import HaxTutorial.Proofs.Proofs
```
Let's type-check all of this:
```
cd proofs/lean
lake build
```
Again, this succeeds, but this time with a warning:
```
warning: HaxTutorial/Proofs/Proofs.lean:25:8: declaration uses `sorry`
```
Everything type-checks, but we haven't proved anything yet. The template just contains the
keyword `sorry` where the proof is supposed to be. This tells Lean: "Sorry, I don't have a proof
for this yet".

Here is a prove that you can use for this specific function:
```{.lean}
@[spec]
theorem square.spec.proof (x : Std.U8) : square.spec x := by
  unfold square.spec square
  hax_mvcgen; grind
```
In practice, AI can help you to generate such proofs. Finally, run `lake build` again to confirm
that Lean now accepts our proof.
